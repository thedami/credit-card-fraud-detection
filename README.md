### Credit Card Fraud Detection

#### Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The goal is to accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent to prevent financial losses.

#### Data
Due to the large size of the dataset, it is not included in this repository. The dataset can be obtained from the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

#### Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled class imbalance using SMOTE.
- **Model Development:** Implemented models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

#### Key Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Provided detailed analysis and comparison of model performance.
